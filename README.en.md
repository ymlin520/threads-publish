# AK體 2.0 - Threads Algorithm Content Decision Skill

`AK-Threads-Booster` remains the internal package name and install id.

AK-Threads-Booster is an AI skill system for Threads creators who want better posting decisions, not just faster text generation.

Its job is to help users:

- find stronger topic angles faster
- avoid obvious repetition and red-line mistakes
- draft in a voice closer to their own
- learn from real post performance over time

It does not guarantee viral posts.

It turns topic selection, drafting, analysis, prediction, and review into a repeatable system backed by the user's own Threads history.

---

## What Is New In 2.0

Version 2.0 turns AK-Threads-Booster from a single-post assistant into a fuller Threads content operating system.

- **Low-token compiled memory**: converts the tracker into an account wiki, post feature index, topic clusters, next-move queue, exemplar bank, and voice fingerprint so daily runs can start from compact runtime memory.
- **Next Move Engine**: recommends not just topics, but the account bottleneck the next post should address, such as stronger judgment, better discussion density, more saveable value, freshness recovery, or lower AI-tone risk.
- **Voice + Cognitive + Draft Operating Pack**: `/voice` now builds a deterministic voice fingerprint first, then distills beliefs, tensions, anti-voice boundaries, and a `/draft` quick-reference pack.
- **Local visual panel**: inspect account health, trends, top posts, topic distribution, compiled memory, and next-move signals with zero token use.
- **Safe `/update` module**: checks for newer versions and can offer opt-in weekly update checks; it only fast-forwards clean repos and never overwrites local changes.
- **Agent-generic packaging**: removes platform-specific install assumptions and exposes `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `agents/openai.yaml` for different agent environments.

---

## Who It Is For

- creators already posting on Threads who want a steadier content process
- users who want to know which topic types actually travel for their account
- users tired of guessing what to post next
- users who want their post history to become a usable decision asset

If the goal is to choose better topics, improve distribution odds, and stop wasting posts on stale or repetitive angles, this skill is built for that.

---

## Core Modules

### `/topics`
Find the next most worthwhile topic by combining historical performance, comment demand, self-repetition risk, and external freshness.

### `/draft`
Generate a draft from the user's brand voice, style guide, and historical data. Before drafting: a freshness gate, a fact-check that **never overrides the user's own stated personal facts or event chronology**, and a research step that surfaces 2-3 angles the user may not have considered. After drafting: 3-5 targeted questions to sharpen the post. All dialogue is toggleable via `threads_booster_config.json` (`ask` / `always_on` / `always_off`).

### `/analyze`
Run decision-first analysis on a finished draft. It checks algorithm red lines, upside drivers, suppression risks, style fit, and AI-tone traces.

### `/predict`
Estimate likely 24-hour performance from comparable historical posts so expectations are anchored in data.

### `/review`
Compare actual results against the prediction and write the learning back into the tracker.

### `/refresh`
Update `threads_daily_tracker.json` through the Threads API when available, or through an authenticated browser automation environment when API access is not available.

### `/voice`
Build a Brand Voice profile that is useful for drafting, not just descriptive. It combines engagement-weighted evidence, temporal shift, cognitive beliefs, tension pairs, anti-voice boundaries, and a `/draft` quick-reference pack.

### `/panel`
Open a local zero-token dashboard for account status, recent trends, top posts, topic distribution, post search, compiled memory, and next-move signals.

### `/update`
Check for newer versions and ask whether the user wants opt-in weekly update checks. Updates only run when the local repo is clean and can fast-forward safely.

---

## What Setup Produces

After `/setup`, the working directory typically contains:

- `threads_daily_tracker.json`
- `style_guide.md`
- `concept_library.md`
- `brand_voice.md` after `/voice`
- `compiled/account_wiki.md`
- `compiled/account_state.md`
- `compiled/next_move_queue.md`
- `compiled/post_feature_index.jsonl`
- `compiled/voice_fingerprint.md` / `.json`
- `posts_by_date.md`
- `posts_by_topic.md`
- `comments.md`

The tracker is the canonical file. Companion files and compiled memory are derived from it; they are useful runtime assets, not new sources of truth.

---

## Recommended Flow

### First-time setup

```text
/setup
/voice
```

This builds the tracker first, then deepens the brand-voice layer for better drafting. The newer `/voice` flow first builds a local voice fingerprint, then uses AI judgment for cognitive core, anti-voice boundaries, and the `/draft` quick-reference pack.

`/voice` produces a **first-draft reference** `brand_voice.md`, not a verdict. An outside LLM always misses things the author knows about themselves. Expected usage:

- Edit anywhere it feels wrong — your edits win.
- Fill in the **Manual Refinements** section at the bottom with taboos, must-do rules, and "not me" phrases.
- Re-runs of `/voice` preserve your edits and the Manual Refinements section.

`/draft` treats Manual Refinements as hard constraints, ranked above other generated sections. It then reads Cognitive Core, the Quick-Reference Pack, Anti-Voice, and Voice Fingerprint.

### Before posting

```text
/topics
/draft
/analyze
```

Use `/topics` to find the best next angle, `/draft` to create a starting point, and `/analyze` to pressure-test the finished draft before publishing.

### Skill Updates

Use `/update` to check whether AK-Threads-Booster has a newer version.

After a check, `/update` will proactively ask whether you want to enable weekly auto-update checks. If enabled, it only fast-forwards when the local repo is clean and safe to update. If local edits, local-only commits, or conflicts exist, it stops and reports the blocker instead of overwriting anything.

### After posting

```text
/predict
/review
```

This closes the loop and makes the next decision better.

### Inspect account status first

```text
/panel
```

Or run locally:

```bash
python scripts/panel_server.py --open
```

The panel is useful before spending tokens on deeper analysis.

## Data Sources

Users can build the system from:

- Threads Developer API token
- Meta official export zip
- existing JSON / Markdown / CSV
- an authenticated browser automation environment logged into Threads
- legacy tracker migration

API access is optional, but it makes refresh much easier.

---

## Product Positioning

This is not a "guaranteed viral post" tool.

The durable promise is:

**help creators find better topics faster and improve the odds that their posts are worth sharing, saving, and discussing.**

That is a stronger and more honest product promise than claiming guaranteed results.

---

## Installation

Give this GitHub repo to your agent:

```text
https://github.com/akseolabs-seo/AK-Threads-booster
```

Agents that support repo instructions or skill directories can read `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md`, then route into `/setup`, `/voice`, `/topics`, `/draft`, `/analyze`, and the other modules.

Environments that support OpenAI/Codex-style discovery can also read `agents/openai.yaml` as UI metadata.

You can also clone it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akseolabs-seo/AK-Threads-booster.git
```

Place the repo in the skill or agent-instructions directory used by the target tool.
