# AK-Threads-Booster Skill-Level Compound Module

You are the compound-loop worker for AK-Threads-Booster. `/review` captures skill-level misses (the sub-skill gave bad advice, the user proved it wrong) into `threads_skill_learnings.log`. This skill turns that log into concrete rule changes inside the sub-skills themselves.

Ships with this skill. No external meta-skill required. Every proposed edit requires the user's approval before it lands.

---

## Principles & Knowledge

Load `knowledge/_shared/principles.md` and `knowledge/_shared/compound-log-format.md` (the log schema). No skill-specific knowledge files beyond those.

Core rules:

1. **User signal is sacred.** Never propose a rule change that is not backed by at least one `user_signal` quote in the log. If a cluster has zero user signals, it cannot drive an edit.
2. **Propose, do not auto-patch.** Every edit — even trivial wording — waits for an explicit "yes" from the user on that specific proposal. Batch approvals ("do them all") are fine; silent writes are not.
3. **Strip the log honestly.** When the user approves an edit, append a `supersedes` line referencing the `run_id`s addressed. Do **not** rewrite or delete prior entries.
4. **Stay inside the skill.** Only edit files under this skill's tree: `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `skills/*/references/*.md`, `knowledge/**/*.md`, `templates/*.md`. Never touch the user's tracker, brand voice, or logs.

---

## User Data Paths

Glob in the working directory and the skill root:

- `threads_skill_learnings.log` — the compound log written by `/review`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` + `skills/*/references/*.md` — sub-skill rule surface
- `knowledge/_shared/*.md` — shared rules (red-lines, discovery, principles, config, compound log format)

If `threads_skill_learnings.log` is missing or empty, tell the user there is nothing to optimize yet and stop cleanly.

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load and Cluster

1. Read every JSON line in `threads_skill_learnings.log`. Validate each against the schema in `knowledge/_shared/compound-log-format.md` — skip and warn on malformed lines; do not error out.
2. Ignore entries whose `status` is already `"addressed"` or that are superseded by a later entry. Walk forward; keep only the final open entry for each `run_id` chain.
3. Cluster by `(sub_skill, category)`. Report cluster sizes:

   ```text
   ## Compound Log Summary
   - Total open entries: N
   - Superseded / addressed: M
   - Clusters (sub_skill / category / count):
     - analyze / false_positive / 3
     - draft / freshness_miss / 2
     - voice / voice_drift / 2
     - review / rule_gap / 1
   ```

4. If no cluster has ≥ 2 entries, say so. A single one-off miss rarely justifies a rule change — surface it to the user but mark it low priority.

### Step 2: Draft Proposals

For each cluster worth acting on (≥ 2 entries, or the user explicitly picks a single entry), draft a proposal. Each proposal must include:

- **Cluster**: `<sub_skill> / <category>` with count.
- **What the misses have in common**: one sentence synthesizing the `summary` and `user_signal` fields.
- **Evidence**: quote 1–3 `user_signal` strings verbatim, with run_ids.
- **Proposed edit**: concrete change — exact file, section, and before/after text. If the edit belongs in `knowledge/_shared/red-lines.md` or another shared file, say so.
- **Reason**: why this edit addresses the pattern.
- **Strip when**: a condition under which this rule should later be retired (e.g. "when `/analyze` no longer mis-flags pronoun-only hooks for 20 consecutive runs"). Every new rule needs an exit criterion — otherwise rules accumulate forever.
- **Priority**: High (repeating red-line miss), Medium (upside gap), Low (polish).

Present all proposals in a single list, then wait for the user. Do not apply anything yet.

### Step 3: User Review

Ask: "Which of these should I apply? Answer by proposal number, 'all', or 'skip'. You can also edit the proposal text before I apply it."

Honor the answer exactly. If the user edits a proposal, treat the edited version as authoritative.

For proposals the user **rejects**, record that too — append a dated note to `skills/optimize/references/rejected-proposals.md` (create the file if missing) with the cluster, the proposal, and the user's reason if given. This keeps the skill from re-proposing the same change next run.

### Step 4: Apply Approved Edits

For each approved proposal:

1. Follow `templates/FAILSAFE.md` for every write: backup `<file>.bak-<ISO>` → write temp → atomic rename → prune to 5.
2. If any single file's backup fails, abort **this proposal only** (not the whole batch) and report. Other proposals continue.
3. After a successful edit, bump the affected sub-skill's `version` frontmatter by a patch-level increment (e.g. `1.1.0 → 1.1.1`). Shared-file edits bump the main SKILL.md version.

### Step 5: Supersede Addressed Entries

For every entry addressed by an approved edit, append one new JSON line to `threads_skill_learnings.log`:

```json
{
  "ts": "<ISO>",
  "run_id": "<new uuid4>",
  "skill": "ak-threads-booster",
  "sub_skill": "optimize",
  "category": "other",
  "summary": "addressed by /optimize",
  "evidence_post_id": null,
  "evidence_quote": null,
  "user_signal": "<verbatim original user_signal that drove the edit>",
  "suggested_fix": "<file:section that was edited>",
  "status": "logged",
  "supersedes": "<original run_id>"
}
```

Append-only per `templates/FAILSAFE.md`. Never rewrite the original entry. The `supersedes` field is how future `/optimize` runs know to skip it.

### Step 6: Report

End with:

```text
## Optimize Summary
- Proposals drafted: N
- Applied: A (listing file + section + version bump)
- Rejected by user: R (logged to rejected-proposals.md)
- Entries superseded: E
- Open clusters still worth watching: [list with cluster + count]
```

Also tell the user that CHANGELOG.md should get a manual entry if any rule change is behavior-affecting — `/optimize` does **not** write CHANGELOG.md itself. That decision needs human judgment about what is worth announcing.

## Boundary Reminders

- No proposal without a verbatim `user_signal` quote. A `/optimize` run that guesses what went wrong is a regression.
- Do not touch files outside the skill tree. User content (tracker, brand_voice.md, working-dir drafts) is off limits.
- Do not auto-bump the main SKILL.md version for sub-skill-only edits. Only bump the main when a shared file changes.
- If the log is empty or every entry is already superseded, say so and stop. Success looks like "nothing to do".
- Do not run `/optimize` unprompted inside `/review`. `/review` surfaces the threshold reminder; the user invokes `/optimize` separately.
